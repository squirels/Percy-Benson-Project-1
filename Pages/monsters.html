                    <h3>Otter</h3>
                    <p>The River Otter in our culture is said to be a shapeshifter and at night if your near the river thinking of anyone you know or love the otter can take the shape of the person in your mind. An otter can change everything but their teeth when they transform, so how you know it is an otter is they always cover their mouths. If they can lure you towards the river at night to get close enough they drag you in. One way of getting rid of an otter approaching is to say it's name in Gitxsan three times then they turn back into an otter.</p>

                    <h3>Moral</h3>
                    <p>This was a way to teach children and youths about dangerous places in this case the river at night. As we are taught to respect our elders and the teachings we learn there is a reason to steer clear of the river at night. Children often don't understand the dangers the river holds and can't comprehend how it can be dangerous, so we have the otter until we grow up and learn that the real dangers are just as scary but can be traversed if you learn more about the rivers dangers.</p>

                    <h3>Sasquatch</h3>
                    <p>The Sasquatch is a terrifying creature in our culture, since they can grow few in numbers it is said that they lure humans deeper into the forest until they are to lost to find their way back by any means. Then they play with the minds of the one lost until they loose their minds becoming bushwhacked and eventually turning into one of them. Just like in other tales and myths a smell of rot proceeds them. They are known to throw rocks hit trees with wood and scream all scare tactics to get someone lost and alone in the woods.</p>

                    <h3>Moral</h3>
                    <p>The forest can be a dangerous place, and often we can become complacent with the dangers and keeping our calm when getting lost or distracted in the woods. The teaching of the sasquatch can instil a sense of constant alertness when it comes to traveling through the forest. For one you should never go alone, second don't get distracted, and lastly do your best not to panic if you get lost.</p>

                    <h3>Heldogwhit</h3>
                    <p>This is a native version of a witch, but in different aspects and ways of becoming one. Originally a Heldogwhit is a Healer that starts using their ability to hurt instead of heal. In our culture there are people we call healers, some can intemperate dreams, some use talents like healing touch, some can dream of the future, and some can speak to those who have passed on. In any case when a healer becomes a very negative person and focus on wishing bad onto others this can change the nature of a healer.</p>

                    <h3>Moral</h3>
                    <p>This moral is very simple. "Do onto others as you would have done onto you", the world is not always cut and dry, black and white; but the one thing we can affect os our reaction to the things out there. Focusing on the negative and judging and manipulation is not something we should aspire to. This simply means to respect others, their choices and free will because at the end of the day the negativity you put out into the world only reflects on yourself.</p>

                    <h3>Owl</h3>
                    <p>The owl can be a bad omen about a death in the household on its way. When an owl sits outside a residence hooting for more then a night they are said to be messengers, meaning they are there to send a sign that someone is about to die within the house it is visiting for consecutive nights. Another thing to remember is to respect the owl because if you hear an owl your not supposed to hoot to it or back at it, if you do so you can be inviting the messenger of death into your life. If you hoot at an owl then if you don't want death to follow you your supposed to keep talking/hooting back until the owl leaves.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Moral</h3>
                    <p>This is about respecting the teachings and creatures around us all. All creatures are apart of the world we share and even if a scary omen is attached to them we are to respect every aspect of our world because you never know what can happen if you are disrespectful or willingly ignorant to the world around you. Treat others equally never mock or judge anyone or their situation because in the end we all have our own life spirit and way of being.</p>
