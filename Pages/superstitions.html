                        <h3>Morals and Monsters</h3>
                        <p>The thing is about every monster there is a moral, and something to learn from it. In real life things can be so cold and detached from what we believe in. This also stems from things we are taught as children, we are told stories that teach lessons and monsters who are defeated but just like real life there isn't always a moral connected to events in life. So these tend to take a turn in how we develop and face life and its turmoils. Just like there is a mystery behind why the otter drags people to the river, there is why do we suffer or hurt so much in the world. why we lose our loved ones without warning or why grief is so devastating when mortality is a fact of life. There will always be questions and not always a suitable answer for each of us. with the stories we tell each other ourselves and our children we are teaching not just morals but belief trust and faith. Faith that there is a moral even if we can't see it at the moment, believing in the ones who teach us; and trust that we are not alone.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural teachings</h3>
                        <p>Most morals in stories basically stay the same, so the similarities between some monsters are not uncommon. But in every culture we have created so many variations and stories that there are monsters of all types all over the world, not just monsters either in some parts of the world they have deities for things as simple as bathrooms to weapons; and others they have demons for every dark aspect of the human psyche. For instance a common myth or mystery is the sasquatch that is in so many different cultures that it is a widely asked question on weather it is real or not simply because it is many different stories in different places. We also have the witches in almost every culture, even in ours to this day it is said there isn't much known about them or how to identify them that people still accuse others for being witches in our community, no seeing or lacking the ability to accept the harsh realities or coincidences that happen; instead rather they find a single person or entity to blame for their misfortune.</p>

                        <h3>Respect and Responsibility</h3>
                        <p>With all cultural teachings they come with a sense of respect, and some even have cautionary tales about respect. Respecting the world, others, elders, nature, and even yourself. When it comes to respect there is a sense of responsibility to pass on the stories and the morals we learned as children, but the trick is how do we respect the tales we are told when we out-grow them. Just like Santa, the tooth fairy and monsters when do we come to terms enough to see past superstitions but still hold respect for them. As we grow older we find out there are no monsters in the dark but there are monstrous acts in the world, things that do hold merit in being afraid of. Just like the monsters of our childhood we have a tendency to whisper about these things and fear the scary things in the world. But we are not children at this point, and how we conquered the monsters of our past we can learn about the darkness in the world and grow from it so that we are aware safe, understanding, wise, and mature enough to know that monsters are not real anymore but only something we can change if we only take the time to learn and understand and sometimes maybe even help finding the morals behind the monsters.</p>

                        <h3>How superstition impacts us</h3>
                        <p>Tell me, do you believe in luck? What about your astral sign? There are so many things in the world in cultures and religion that teach us that there is nothing wrong with superstition, and there are so many types of it that we rarely notice when some of them become common place. throwing salt over your shoulder was once done because we believed that there was a mischievous creature that would perch itself on the left shoulder of someone so the salt was an opertunity to be rid of the creature. If we understand why we learned these superstitious traits they can be helpful but to some they can ruin the idea of self. Leaving nothing up to you, but everything is just luck and destiny. Some ideas of luck can definitely impact your thinking and your thinking and focus can make it a reality if it is something you simply believe and don't question anymore. When you start thinking in absolutes you leave no room for growth, just like saying destiny, true love, or your faith defines you as a person becomes a wall in your personal growth. Saying that your true love is out there is beautiful but will you stay in one place and as you are thinking the world will do it for you? I know I used to think of myself as lucky because of despite my shortcomings I do have a lot of things going for me, this is something I did always keep in mind because of the issues I faced and still learning about. for a long time I did think that my luck was tied to who I was and how I lived and that played a positive and negative roll in my daily life but as I grew I realized instead of putting my belief in the world having an effect on my life I could affect my own life by simply doing things in my life and mind, as well as mindset. I know I could be wrong in so many ways in my own beliefs but I do think growing is apart of my journey and I don't want anything to stop that for me. for a video on click <a href="https://youtu.be/quOdF1CAPXs?si=otdXxkLMjWD-DsiV" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
