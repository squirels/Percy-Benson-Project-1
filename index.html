                    <h2>Teaching Fear</h2>
                    <p>Every culture has monsters and myths as well as legends that are passed down and taught to the next generations as youths. These are often ways of teaching the dangers of the world to our young, and usually carries on to adulthood instilling beliefs faith along with fear. As youths we are not able to comprehend the dangers of the world or be able to fully grasp the consequences of not following social norms. In a lot of ways this doesn't change as we grow older, what we can't explain or understand we give over to powers we know not of. Be it God a creator the demons who try corrupt, ghosts of our lost loved ones. I want to brush up on the ones I was taught growing up, and what they taught me before I was old enough to understand how dangerous the world is around me.</p>

                    <h2>Monsters</h2>
                    <p>Monsters are in every culture across the world each part of it having monsters in the waters, in the mountains, in the trees underground, and even in the skies flying through the night. For every monster hides a moral, or a teaching, a lesson we all need to learn or a part of the world that can be explained along with the story of the monsters that come along with us as we live. For my culture there are a few I can name and you can see my communities monsters and myths that go with the fears taught in our community in the subject listings at the top of the page. Mythical creatures are used in every culture for good and bad teachings and we use them today just as often as we did back before scientists discovered more about the world and how it works. We have angels and demons Santa who knows if your good or bad, and so many more around the world for some cultures the is even a deity for almost everything, and a demon to go with them.</p>

                    <h2>Superstitions</h2>
                    <p>Just like monsters we have superstitions that go with the teachings, some are to teach respect others are for comfort; but all have meaning tied to them. In our culture a simple superstition can turn something as simple as an owl at night into a monster because of the time and place, in Gitxsan culture an owl outside hooting someones house is an omen of death. We also believe to keep music down and not hold any celebrations because it can disturb the spirit and keep them from moving on. Just like monsters superstition comes from a place of fear but using something to add to what we can't fully understand in place of the unknown. Bad luck, good luck is used across the world but has no real relevance or proof that it is real. superstition is a lifting off place that we can eventually come to terms with the reality of the world, in my theory having faith and believing is a great thing and is important but knowing the difference between important life lessons that go with them and ones we follow blindly is an important distinction. I do find them fascinating and I love the study of superstitions so if your interested I have another page of some basic superstitions that some from my community and some that are just interesting and fun to know the reasons for. To see a more in-depth see superstitions in the subject listings.</p>

                    <h2>Why we find fear fun by TED Ed.</h2>
                    <p>For me especially I am a big fan of horror, not just the scary aspect but the Psychology of it all. I do enjoy scary content though and even use it to fall asleep to because it is something I am fascinated with and enjoy listening to horror stories.</p>
